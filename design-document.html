<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The program operates by being given a plain text guitar tab file as input from the user and converting it to a pretty-printed PDF. A Graphical User Interface is used to select the tab, as well as where to save the PDF. When the conversion process is complete, the final PDF is opened for the user to view.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-design">High-Level Design</h2>

<p>As per project requirements, we use the iTextPDF library to convert a userâ€™s tab files to a formatted PDF version of the sheet music. The user of this application interacts only with our graphical user interface, which abstracts away the inner workings of the system. The result is a user-friendly application that is quick and easy to use.</p>

<p>The software is designed similarly to the way a programming language compiler converts code from human readable instructions (<code>int x = 3 + 2;</code>) into machine-readable instructions (<code>add eax, ebx</code>). There are two phases involved when converting from tab to PDF. The first phase consists of transforming the symbols of the tab into Java Objects that we can work with. The second phase takes these Objects and draws them into the PDF document.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Technical Note:</em> the first phase is not unlike converting code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), a technique used in compilers. Failure to create an AST in compilers can be due to a syntax error (such as the code <code>int 3;</code> producing <code>error: not a statement</code> in Java).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Objects that represent tab notation implement a common Interface, <code>ITabNotation</code>, which we use to guarantee us the Object can perform certain tasks. We use <code>IParser</code> Objects to create these <code>ITabNotation</code> objects out of the guitar tab. A <code>PDFCreator</code> uses these <code>ITabNotation</code> Object to create the final PDF.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Technical Note:</em> <code>ITabNotation</code> Objects are reflexive and symmetric. calling <code>toString()</code> on <code>ITabNotation</code> must yield the <strong>exact</strong> string that the <code>IParser</code> created it with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This architecture lends itself to apply certain design patterns. Example of some of the design patterns used include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Iterator Pattern, to traverse collections of <code>ITabNotation</code> Objects</li>
<li>Factory Pattern: our <code>IParser</code> Objects are factories that create <code>ITabNotation</code> Objects</li>
<li>Visitor Pattern: our <code>PDFCreator</code> visits each <code>ITabNotation</code> Object to construct the PDF.</li>
</ul></div></body>
